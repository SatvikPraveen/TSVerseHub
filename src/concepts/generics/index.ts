  overview: {
    introduction: `
The TypeScript Compiler API provides programmatic access to TypeScript's parsing, type checking, and transformation capabilities. This powerful API allows you to build sophisticated development tools, code analyzers, and custom transformations.

Whether you're building IDE extensions, linting tools, code generators, or custom build processes, the Compiler API gives you the same capabilities that TypeScript itself uses internally.

Key capabilities include:
- Parsing TypeScript/JavaScript code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- Performing type checking and analysis
- Creating custom transformations and code modifications
- Generating diagnostic messages and error reporting
- Building development tools and IDE integrations
